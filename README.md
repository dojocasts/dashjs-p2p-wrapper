# dashjs-p2p-wrapper

This module wraps [`dash.js`](https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/dash.js) to bootstrap it with [the Streamroot P2P module](http://streamroot.io).

It provides a bundle that extends the [`dash.js`](https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/dash.js) `MediaPlayer` constructor to create a fully configured player which will use the Streamroot P2P module, giving you the exact same API.
You can integrate this bundle with minimal changes in your application. **The bundled version of dash.js is a fork of v2.6.0**. This fork includes a fix for SegmentTemplate streams that only affects P2P efficiency (it has no effect on playback).

It also provides a wrapper that allows you to create/configure a player with a specific version of [`dash.js`](https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/dash.js). **Minimum supported version of dash.js is v2.4.1.**

## Important note

Streamroot P2P module currently has compatibility issues when BOLA is activated on live streams. VOD is fine. We highly recommend you to deactivate BOLA for live streaming (including DVR streams):
- for versions 2.5.0 and earlier: it is disabled by default. Make sure you did not activate it using the setter `enableBufferOccupancyABR`
- for versions 2.6.0 and later: by default dash.js dynamically switches between throughput based rules and BOLA. Use `mediaPlayer.setABRStrategy("abrThroughput")` to disable BOLA (see [dash.js documentation](http://cdn.dashjs.org/latest/jsdoc/module-MediaPlayer.html#setABRStrategy__anchor))

Contact Streamroot support for more information.

### Install via npm
You can install the artifacts distributed as NPM modules:

For the wrapper with dash.js included:

```
npm install streamroot-dashjs-p2p-bundle
```

For the wrapper without dash.js:

```
npm install streamroot-dashjs-p2p-wrapper
```

In your application import/require the package you want to use as in the example like

```javascript
import DashjsP2PBundle from 'streamroot-dashjs-p2p-bundle';
```

or

```javascript
import DashjsWrapper from 'streamroot-dashjs-p2p-wrapper';
```

### Build

#### Prerequisites

Make sure you are using a Node.js version >= 6.0.0.

#### Clone this repo

```
git clone https://github.com/streamroot/dashjs-p2p-wrapper.git
```

#### Install library dependencies

```
npm install
```

#### Build the library

```
npm run build
```

The results will be in the destination folders `dist/wrapper` and `dist/bundle`.

To build and compile-watch development/debug versions use ```npm run wrapper_dev``` or ```npm run bundle_dev``` for wrapper and bundle respectively.

### Tests

For running unit tests (in node.js), use

```
npm test
```

### Example

#### Bundle

Include the bundle build in your app.

```html
<head>
    <!-- path to dashjs-p2p-bundle build -->
    <script src="dashjs-p2p-bundle.js"></script>
</head>
```

Use the MediaPlayer bundle factory provided by `dashjs-p2p-bundle` to create dash.js player.

```javascript
var p2pConfig = {
    streamrootKey: YOUR_STREAMROOT_KEY_HERE
};

var player = DashjsP2PBundle.MediaPlayer().create(p2pConfig);

var videoElementId = "videoPlayer";
var videoElement = document.getElementById(videoElementId);
var manifestURL = "example.mpd";
var autoStart = true;
player.initialize(videoElement, url, autoStart);
```

#### Wrapper

Include the wrapper build and dash.js build in your app.

```html
<head>
    <!-- path to dashjs-p2p-wrapper build -->
    <script src="dashjs-p2p-wrapper.js"></script>

    <!-- dash.js build of your choice starting from version 2.2.0 and higher -->
    <script src="dash.all.debug.js"></script>
</head>
```

Create a dash.js MediaPlayer instance. Create wrapper instance, passing dash.js player, `p2pConfig` and `liveDelay` value as constructor params. Recommended `liveDelay` value is 30 seconds.

```javascript
var player = dashjs.MediaPlayer().create();

var p2pConfig = {
    streamrootKey: YOUR_STREAMROOT_KEY_HERE
};

var liveDelay = 30;
var dashjsWrapper = new DashjsWrapper(player, p2pConfig, liveDelay);
var videoElementId = "videoPlayer";
var videoElement = document.getElementById(videoElementId);
var manifestURL = "example.mpd";
var autoStart = true;
player.initialize(videoElement, manifestURL, autoStart);
```

To see full sample code and extended possibilities of how to use this module, take a look at the code in the `example` directory.

#### Wrapper with specific release of Dash.js from CDN

If you want to test the wrapper with a specific version of Dash.js, you could generate an example page with a specific version of Dash.js using:

```
npm run generate_example -- <Dash.js version>
```

For example `npm run generate_example -- 2.4.1` will generate `example2.4.1.wrapper.html` with Dash.js `2.4.1` instead of the bundled Dash.js `2.6.0`.

### Configuration

Specify your `streamrootKey` in the `p2pConfig` object. If you don't have it, go to [Streamroot's dashboard](http://dashboard.streamroot.io/) and sign up. It's free. You can check other `p2pConfig` options in the [documentation](https://streamroot.readme.io/docs/p2p-config).

### Peer agent instance exposure

#### Bundle

Not available yet.

#### Wrapper

A `peerAgent` public API is exposed on a `DashjsWrapper` instance -- `wrapper.peerAgent`.
List of peerAgent's public API getters/setters is documented here https://streamroot.readme.io/docs/peeragent-class-reference.

### Run demos

Start a local server like `http-server` or `node-static` in the project root, on port 8080 if you like.

Now visit <http://localhost:8080/example/bundle.html> for bundle demo or <http://localhost:8080/example/wrapper.html> for wrapper demo.

To see some p2p traffic open several browser tabs/windows playing the same manifest (so there will be peers to exchange p2p traffic).

### Player integration

The module is integrated in the following players:

* [Video.js 5](https://github.com/videojs/video.js/) through [videojs5-dashjs-p2p-source-handler](https://github.com/streamroot/videojs5-dashjs-p2p-source-handler)
